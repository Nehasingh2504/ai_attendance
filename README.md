# AI Attendance System

> **Smart, real-time attendance using face recognition and image upload**

---

## 🔎 Project Overview

An **AI-powered Attendance Management System** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, integrating a **Face Recognition API** for real-time student identification through a webcam and modern front-end tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

The system supports real-time face detection using OpenCV and automatic face recognition to identify students/employees instantly. Attendance can be marked through live webcam scanning or by uploading a photo manually.

It also allows creating separate databases for each class, keeping student details and attendance records organized and independent.
Perfect for schools, colleges, coaching centers, and offices looking for a simple, smart, and fully automated attendance solution.

## 🎥 Real-time Recognition Mode

* System captures video feed from webcam.
* Detects faces using OpenCV.
* Recognizes registered students using trained model.
* Marks attendance instantly in the class database.

### 🖼️ Upload Image Mode

* Instructor uploads student photo manually.
* Backend compares the uploaded image with known embeddings.
* If a match is found, attendance is marked.

### 🗂️ Class & Database Management

* Each new class created has its own SQLite database file.
* Each database stores unique student and attendance records.
* Admins can switch between classes or merge reports.
